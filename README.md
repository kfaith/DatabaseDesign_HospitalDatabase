# DatabaseDesign_HospitalDatabase
This repository holds the final project for the class, in which my group created a GUI for a hospital system.

The two goals of this assignment were to:

1.   Be able to design a database for a small application.
2.   Be able to programmatically interact with a relational database management system

The application can Insert, Select, Update, and Delete data, while keeping data consistent throughout the 12 tables.
Ideally, the program could be used by a hospital system in order to keep track of supplies, patients, payroll, etc.
